Initialization:

Description: This stage involves setting up the initial infrastructure for version control, establishing repositories, and configuring access permissions.
Example: Initializing a Git repository using git init command in a project directory.

Branching:
Description: Branching allows developers to create independent lines of development, enabling them to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Example: Creating a feature branch named "login-page" using git checkout -b login-page.

Development:
Description: Developers work on their respective branches, implementing new features, fixing bugs, and making improvements.
Example: Adding authentication functionality to the login page in the "login-page" branch.

Merging:
Description: Merging brings changes from one branch (source) into another (target), consolidating work and resolving any conflicts that may arise.
Example: Merging the "login-page" branch into the main branch using git merge login-page.

Testing:
Description: After merging changes, thorough testing is conducted to ensure that new features work as expected and existing functionality remains intact.
Example: Running automated unit tests and manual testing of the login page to verify authentication functionality.

Review:
Description: Code review involves peers examining the changes made by developers to catch errors, ensure adherence to coding standards, and provide feedback for improvement.
Example: Conducting a peer review of the code changes made in the "login-page" branch before merging into the main branch.

Deployment:
Description: Deploying the tested and reviewed code to production or staging environments for end-users to access and interact with.
Example: Deploying the updated application with the new login functionality to a staging server for user acceptance

Testing.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Description: After deployment, monitoring tools are used to track performance, identify issues, and provide ongoing support and maintenance.
Example: Monitoring server logs and user feedback to address any issues with the login feature and applying patches or updates as needed.
Throughout these stages, effective communication, collaboration, and documentation are essential for successful software development. SCM tools like Git provide the necessary infrastructure to manage the life cycle and facilitat
